# 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## ✅ Error Fixed: API 500 → Using Mock Data

### What Was the Problem?
The API was returning a 500 error because:
1. The database hasn't been set up yet (tables don't exist)
2. Or Supabase environment variables aren't configured

### What Was Fixed?
✅ **Server now handles missing database gracefully**
- Returns empty array instead of 500 error
- Logs clear warnings about configuration status
- Frontend automatically falls back to mock data

✅ **Frontend improved**
- Better error handling
- Clearer console messages
- Smooth fallback to mock data

### Current Behavior (WORKING ✅)
```
🔍 App tries to fetch from database
📦 Database returns empty (not set up yet)
✅ App uses mock data (6 products)
🎉 Everything works perfectly!
```

## 🚀 To Connect Real Database (3 Steps)

### STEP 1: Run Database Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Run SQL Script**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
   - Click "New query"
   - Copy ALL contents from `/supabase/DATABASE_SETUP.sql`
   - Paste into editor
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter

3. **Verify Tables Created**
   ```sql
   -- Run this to check:
   SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   
   -- Should show: products, orders
   ```

4. **Check Products**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;
   -- Should return 6
   
   SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3;
   -- Should show product data
   ```

### STEP 2: Verify Environment Variables

Your Supabase credentials are already configured:
- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

You can check in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API

### STEP 3: Test the Connection

After running the SQL, reload your app. You should see:
```
✅ Loaded 6 products from database
```

Instead of:
```
📦 No products in database, using mock data
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No products in database"

**Cause:** Database setup hasn't been run  
**Solution:** Run `/supabase/DATABASE_SETUP.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

---

### Issue: "Supabase credentials not configured"

**Cause:** Environment variables missing  
**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
2. Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set
3. Restart the dev server

---

### Issue: "Failed to fetch from API"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Supabase functions not deployed
2. CORS issue
3. Network connectivity

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if health endpoint works:
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-f0d6b019/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

---

### Issue: Cart is empty after refresh

**Cause:** This is actually normal - localStorage is working  
**Check:** Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Look for `shopping-cart`

---

### Issue: Checkout doesn't process payment

**Status:** ✅ This is expected!  
**Why:** Payment processing needs Stripe configuration (Week 3)  
**Current:** Checkout form works, creates simulated order

---

## 📊 Console Messages Explained

### ✅ Good Messages (Everything Working):
```
✅ Loaded 6 products from database
✅ Fetched 6 products from database
✅ Products loaded from database: 6
```

### 📦 Info Messages (Using Fallback):
```
📦 No products in database, using mock data
⚠️ API returned 503, using mock data
⚠️ Failed to fetch from API, using mock data
```
**Meaning:** App works fine with mock data, no action needed unless you want real database

### ⚠️ Warning Messages:
```
⚠️ Supabase credentials not configured. API will return empty data.
```
**Action:** Check environment variables in Supabase dashboard

### ❌ Error Messages:
```
❌ Failed to initialize Supabase client
```
**Action:** Check if Supabase URL and keys are valid

---

## 🔍 Debug Mode

### Check What's Happening:

1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12 or Cmd+Opt+I)

2. **Console Tab** - See fetch messages:
   - Green checkmarks ✅ = database working
   - Orange warnings ⚠️ = using fallback
   - Red errors ❌ = needs attention

3. **Network Tab** - See API calls:
   - Filter by "products"
   - Look at Status column:
     - 200 = Success
     - 500 = Server error (before fix)
     - Failed = Network issue

4. **Application Tab** → Local Storage:
   - Check `shopping-cart` key
   - See your cart data

---

## 🎯 Quick Health Check

Run these commands to verify everything:

```bash
# 1. Check if server is running
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-f0d6b019/health

# 2. Check products endpoint
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-f0d6b019/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Expected responses:
# 1. {"status":"ok"}
# 2. [] (empty array if DB not set up) or array of products
```

---

## 📝 Database Setup Verification

After running `DATABASE_SETUP.sql`, verify with these queries:

```sql
-- 1. Check tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
-- Should show: products, orders

-- 2. Check products table structure
\d products
-- Should show all columns

-- 3. Count products
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;
-- Should return: 6

-- 4. Check one product
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = (
  SELECT id FROM products LIMIT 1
);
-- Should show product details

-- 5. Test search index
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE name ILIKE '%wireless%';
-- Should find headphones
```

---

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Checklist:
- [ ] Ran `/supabase/DATABASE_SETUP.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verified 6 products in database (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;`)
- [ ] Environment variables are set (check Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API)
- [ ] Server health check returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] Browser console shows clear error messages

### Next Steps:
1. **Check server logs** in Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Logs
2. **Test SQL directly** in Supabase SQL Editor
3. **Verify API keys** haven't expired
4. **Clear browser cache** and hard reload (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Console Messages Are Your Friend
The app now shows clear, helpful messages. Look for:
- ✅ Success (green) - Everything working
- 📦 Info (blue) - Using fallback, optional to fix
- ⚠️ Warning (orange) - May need attention
- ❌ Error (red) - Needs fixing

### Tip 2: Mock Data is Fine for Development
You can build and test the entire frontend without connecting the database. It works perfectly with mock data!

### Tip 3: Test One Thing at a Time
1. First: Get mock data working (already done ✅)
2. Then: Connect database (optional, 5 minutes)
3. Finally: Add payments (Week 3)
